# indicam-hacs

HausNet Indicam component for Home Assistant. Read the installation documentation
[here](https://docs.hausnet.io/indicam/#home-assistant-custom-component).

Note that, after the installation of the component, the component needs to be configured
in the `configuration.yaml` file before it is activated. The configuration changes
will require another reboot in addition to the one required after installation. You can save a 
step by delaying the reboot until after configuration.
